# Project 1

Welcome!

This is my first website created for the purposes of my submission for project 1 of the course.

In this project I have used only HTML and CSS, I had considered going ahead to learn JavaScript (and potentially other systems) for better functionality for the project but I decided that it would be better to use only HTML and CSS to showcase my proficiency in these systems. Making it fairer and easier to mark.

For my first project I had considered many different ideas, including a website for a local business, however as the website would have limitations, such as not using JavaScript for functionality, and that there was a practical gap between the online gateway for payment that this would offer a sub-par website for the business.

Therefore I decided that my first project will be a website for my own business. To fully explain, I am a self-employed sole trader, I offer consulting services to merchants/business for hardware and software pertaiing to payment solutions such as ECOM, MOTO, handheld devices etc. Hence my affinity with local businesses and the initial desire to build a website as my first project as this provides practical value in which I could have had a third party business owner provide me with a set of instructions.

As a website built for my own purposes, this project has a personal and practical value, as I will be able to ensure that the website contains trueful and relevant information. I would also be able to fulfill everything I would need in a website to suit my professional needs, whilst allowing the shortfalls of not having advanced functionality afforded by JavaScript at this stage.

I plan to use other tools to continually improve the website at later dates allowing for future development but I do not plan to use my website again for a later project as I would like to use different ideas to showcase my abilities and I would look to shift back to a local business once I have the neccessary tools required, however there are no set in stone plans as it were.

This project will showcase myself as a consultancy business, the products and services that I offer with active promotions, links to my own social media, information and links to the contracted client known as SumUp. 

Not only will this project aim to generate business for myself, which in turn provides business for my contracted client, but will also showcase my skills to local businesses and generate further business by offering them my software skills for website creation.
